feat(finance): implement real financial reports and finish ERP core sales flow

- Implemented `DashboardService.getSellersPerformance` aggregating `Order` and `Quote` data (Revenue, Conversion Rate, Commissions).
- Implemented `DashboardService.getArchitectsPerformance` aggregating sales by architect's customers.
- Exposed new endpoints: `GET /dashboard/finance/sellers` and `GET /dashboard/finance/architects`.
- Updated Frontend Pages (`/vendedores`, `/arquitetos`) to fetch real data via `useQuery` instead of mock data.
- Refactored `DashboardController` to use standard `@Query` params for date filtering.
- Validated End-to-End flow with `scripts/test-live-flow.ts` (Order -> Delivery).
- Updated project plan (`PLAN-erp-revestimentos.md`) and walkthrough documentation.

This commit completes the core "Financial Reports" phase (Phase 4), ensuring all sales and commission logic is backed by real database records.
